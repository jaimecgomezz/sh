# sh
collection of personal scripts

## Scripts

- [blk](blk): Easily block internet pages

## Installation

To quickly make them available, simply add the folder to the `PATH`.

```sh
~ $ git clone https://github.com/jaimecgomezz/sh
~ $ export PATH="$PATH:~/sh"
```

## History

I've been learning a couple of things since I released [scripts](https://github.com/jaimecgomezz/scripts), my first collection of executables. At that moment, I used to see them as a well thought-out project... and... no, not really! I decided to keep them because they reflect how I understood and design scripts.
